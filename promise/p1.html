    Promise :- Promise is used to handle multiple asynchronous operation easily.
    prior to promise callback were used but it leads to umnanageable code.

    1.pending
    2.resolved/fullfilled
    3.reject
    4.settled

   var p = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{//resolve(), reject()

   });

   p.then(()=>{
    console.log("promise is resolved ......then callback is triggered");
   }).catch(()=>{
    console.log("promise is rejected .....catch callback is triggered");
